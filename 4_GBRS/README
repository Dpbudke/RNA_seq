This is now the complete compilation of necessary scripts to do GBRS allele-specific-expression in CC mice. Look at Rstudio/GBRS for documentation of how 
I generated the necessary transition probabaility files for CC mice. I intend to extend GBRS to assess ASE in CCRIX mice, but need to work through generating 
CCRIX transprob files first.
